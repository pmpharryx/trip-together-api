## Source Code

Adopting a **package-by-feature** approach organizes the source code to enhance modularity and scalability.
Each feature package encapsulates its specific components, such as constants, controllers, DTOs, models, repositories,
services, and validators, making the codebase easier to navigate and maintain. Shared components are centralized in the
`common` package to avoid duplication and ensure consistency across features.

This design promotes **high cohesion** and **low coupling**, where each feature is self-contained with closely related
functionalities, reducing dependencies between features and improving maintainability and flexibility.

## Application Configuration

A centralized location for application properties and configurations.

You can configure application-specific properties in the `src/main/resources/application.yaml` file.

**Directory:** `./src/main/resources`

    src/main/resources
    │
    └── application.yaml                        # Main application configuration file

---

## Test Script

A centralized location for unit test scripts for testing individual units or components of the application in isolation.

The structure keeps test files organized and easy to locate, with each test package corresponding to its respective
source package. Each test package contains tests for the components within that package, such as controllers, services,
repositories, validators, etc.

**Directory:** `./src/test/java/com/triptogether/api`

    src/test/java/com/triptogether/api

    │
    ├── feature2                                # Tests for components in Feature 2
    │
    ├── ...                                     # Tests for components in other features
    │
    └── TripTogetherApiApplicationTests.java    # Tests for main application class
